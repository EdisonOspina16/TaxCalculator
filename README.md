# Tax Calculator
The "Tax Calculator" project aims to develop an application to calculate the income tax return of an employee. The application will take into account various inputs, such as employment income, other income, withholdings, social security payments, pension contributions, mortgage loans, donations, and education expenses for the year. With this information, you will calculate the taxed and untaxed income, the deductible costs, and finally determine the amount to be paid for income tax. This tool will make it easier for employees to calculate and submit their annual income tax return.
